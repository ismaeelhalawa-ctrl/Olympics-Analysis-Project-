# Olympics Analysis Project
This file contains data on athletes participating in the Olympic Games over multiple years . The main problem here is to understand how the participation of athletes from different countries has changed over time ? , as well as to analyze the different characteristics and achievements that affect athletic performance, such as gender or age.

Analyzing the Olympic Games:
<> To begin analyzing the file data, we must verify the validity of the information and its source, then read it.
<> We clean the data of duplicate, missing, or inaccurate values ​​using the Pandas library and categorize it by gender and year.
<> We then try to find a relationship between variables such as age, type of sport, and country.
<> Finally, we use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to display the results and analyze time trends through graphs.

Analysis Results:
1) The analysis showed a continuous increase in the number of participants in the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016, indicating the Games' sharp growth and expansion.
2) The analysis also showed a greater increase in the number of participants in the summer than in the winter.
3) The analysis also showed changes in the distribution of medals over the years. In the early Games, medals were concentrated among a specific number of countries, but over time, this distribution expanded due to the increased number of participating countries
